Note:
<span style="color:red;">I am currently aware of lag issue caused by all the palettes being on one page. I will fix this by the time I have finished.</span>

### What is this?
webQuilt is a easy to use website that supplies many great hand-picked colours so that whether your creating your first website or making a colourful logo, you can design it to the best of your ability.

### What's the status for this website as of 18/05/2017?
webQuilt is still in development and I have only just completed the front section of the page. I hope to see the project completed within a week or two.

### Why is this better over any other color website?
webQuilt is being built on the thought that it will contain heavy categorization and hundreds of palettes to choose from, an example of atleast three of these are **Web Palette: Dark Theme**, **Art Palette: Shades of Snow** and **The offical webQuilt Palette**. 

### Future plans
- ~~Side Nav~~
- Zoom feature ✔️
- Palettes
- User created palettes
- Color organization

### The developer.
I am creating this site solo, I am currently learning things like Javascript, Sass (reason of website being created in the first place), PHP and more. I have only been programming for about a year in general, web development about half of that so I am always happy to hear suggestions or feedback from any other experienced developers.
