### What is this?
webQuilt is a easy to use website that supplies many great hand-picked colours so that whether your creating your first website or making a colourful logo, you can design it to the best of your ability.

### What's the status for this website as of 18/05/2017?
webQuilt is still in development and I have only just completed the front section of the page. I hope to see the project completed within a week or two.

### Why is this better over any other color website?
webQuilt is being built on the thought that it will contain heavy categorization and hundreds of palettes to choose from, an example of atleast three of these are **Web Palette: Dark Theme**, **Art Palette: Shades of Snow** and **The offical webQuilt Palette**. 

### The developer.
I am creating this site solo, I am currently learning things like PHP, Sass (reason of website being created in the first place), JS and more. I have only been programming for about a year so I am always happy to hear suggestions or feedback from any other experienced developers.
